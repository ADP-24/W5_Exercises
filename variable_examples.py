# if - Used to create a conditional statement that executes a block of code only if a specified condition evaluates to true.
# for - Used to create a loop that iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) or other iterable objects.
# try - Used to start a block of code that will be tested for errors during execution. It can be followed by except, finally, or else to handle exceptions.^^
